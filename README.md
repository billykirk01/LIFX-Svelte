# LIFX-Svelte

A simple single page web application built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to control LIFX lights bulbs via the [Lifx HTTP protocol](http://api.developer.lifx.com/). The backend is a thin library that I wrote (see [LIFX-HTTP](https://github.com/wkirk01/LIFX-HTTP)) to wrap the LIFX API that makes use of native Fetch API's and pure Typescript ES Modules.
